"Elon Musk's daily work schedule Elon Musk's daily routine can be summed up as work, eat, sleep, with work taking up a bulk of that time. With a bedtime of around 1am, Musk typically
wakes up at 7am, getting 6 to 6.5 hours of sleep, which, he discovered over
 the years is his sweet spot.

'Sleep is really great. I find if I don't get enough sleep Im quite grumpy.
 I could drop below a certain threshold of sleep, although I would be awake
 more hours I would get less done because my mental acuity would be affected,'

 In a 2016 interview with Y Combinator,
  -Musk described an example day in his life juggling Tesla and SpaceX:

'Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer.
 She kind of manages legal finance sales and kind of general business activity
 and then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team working on improving
 the Falcon 9 and the Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars colonial architecture.
 And then at Tesla, it's working on the Model 3 and some in the design studio typically
 half a day a week dealing with aesthetics and look and feel things.
 And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself
 as well as the engineering of the factory because the biggest epiphany I've had this year
 is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine the factory and that is
 at least towards a magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.'
 
 When it comes to productivity for himself and employees, Musk is well-known for his ruthless
 efficiency. In a 2018 email sent out to Tesla employees, Musk outlined some of his 'recommendations'
 for conducting efficient meetings:

  -Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time.
  Please get rid of all large meetings, unless you're certain they are providing value to the
  whole audience, in which case keep them very short.
  
  -Also get rid of frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter.
 Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.
 
  -Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren't adding value.
  It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.

 In the same email, Musk also told employees to avoid using 'acronyms or nonsense words for objects,
  software or processes at Tesla' and encouraged the 'free flow of information between all levels,'
  no matter the employee's role or department.

 While Musk has seemingly embraced his workaholic habits and long hours, everyone has a breaking
  point, and in 2018, it appeared that breaking point was getting dangerously close for him.
  In a New York Times profile, Musk detailed work weeks of up to 120 hours,
  'There were times when I didn't leave the factory for three or four days ' days when I didn't go
  outside,' he said. 'This has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.'

 In a Recode Decode inteview with Kara Swisher, Musk talked about the difficult times in more detail,
 ï¿½I would just sort of sleep for a few hours, work, sleep for a few hours, work, 
 seven days a week. Some of those days must have been 120 hours, or something nutty.'
 Fortunately for Musk, the days of 120 hour workweeks are over (for now), and he's back
 to 80 or 90 hours, which he says is 'pretty sustainable.'

More recently, it seems that Musk is in a much better place, work-life balance-wise.
 In a conversation with Maureen Dowd for The New York Times, he spoke about spending
 time with his partner, Grimes, catching up on anime (Death Note and Evangelion) and listening 
 to history audiobooks and podcasts.

When asked about how he managed to find time to spend with his children,
 given his immense working hours, Musk replied, 'Right now there's not much I can do.
 Grimes has a much bigger role than me right now. When the kid gets older, there will be more of a role for me.'

'I think just doing what I've done with my other kids. If I have a trip for Tesla to China,
 for example, I'll bring the kids with me and we'll go see the Great Wall or we took the bullet train from Beijing to Xian
 and saw the Terracotta Warriors.'
